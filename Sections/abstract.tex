Video based job interviews and resumes are increasing in popularity among organizations and corporations. They are a vital part in today's job candidate screening process and prove to be more cost efficient than previous types of interviews and resumes. These advancements make way for the automatic screening of job candidates by analyzing and modeling video based data-sets. To be more precise, the assessment of apparent personality traits and mood primitives give insight into the impressions a job candidate leaves on a job recruiter. In this thesis we describe a video based system that analyzes a video clip of a person and then produces personality trait and mood scores. On top of that, it predicts whether the person should be invited to a job interview or not. This thesis explores several types of classification models to make accurate predictions but also to provide an explainable and interpretable model. The results show that the agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness dimensions have the most influence on the job interview prediction.
